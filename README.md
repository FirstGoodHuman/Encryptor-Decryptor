Hallo,
This little programm can "Encrypt" and "Decrypt" files. (I mean files that encrypted with this programm first!)
File formats like (.jpg - .txt - .png and ...)
Also u can use a folder path to Encrypt / Decrypt files in that folder!
It could be useful :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:

1) A computer with CPU.
2) Installed Python.
3) Happy Life.

*It works only in Windows!*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

U can use it super easly...

1)  First "Run it as Administrator", when u run it, it start and download/update some libraries... (Need internet!)

2)  Then, u see this massage:

3)  Its easy to undrestand, BTW...

* If its the first time that u use this little programm, u should press key "1" (as this massage said, for the first time!)
* Or, if u wanna creat difference key to encrypt new files...
* When u press "1", this will creat a new file named "key.key" in your Desktop location (C:/Users/"Your username"/Desktop/key.key)
