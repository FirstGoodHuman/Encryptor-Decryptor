Hallo,
This little programm can "encrypt" and "dycrypt" files. (I mean files that encrypted with this programm first!)
It could be useful :)



U can use it super easly...

1)  First when u run it, it start and download/update some library... (Need internet!)

2)  Then, u see this massage:

"""
Do you want to :
<Generate a new KEY>     [1]    (For The First Time..)
<ENCRYPT a File>         [2]
<DECRYPT a File>         [3]
<EXIT>                   [X]
"""

3)  Its easy to undrestand, BTW...
* If its the first time that u use this little programm, u should press key "1" (as this massage said, for the first time!)
* Or, if u wanna creat difference key to encrypt new files...
* When u press "1", this will creat a new file named "key.key" in your Desktop location (C:/Users/"Your username"/Desktop/key.key)

4)  To Encrypt files, press key "2"
When u press "2", u see this one:

"""
Enter The Target Location For 'Encrypt' ->
"""

It means paste the target path to Encrypt.
(If it succeeds, will show this massage:
"File/Folder was encrypted.")

5)  To Decrypt files, press key "3"
When u press "3", u see this one:

"""
Enter The Target Location For 'Dncrypt' ->
"""

It means paste the target path to Decrypt.
(If it succeeds, will show this massage:
"File/Folder was decrypted.")

6)  To exit, press key "X"
When u press "X", u see noting :)


*** be careful : To decrypt files, u need the file named "key.key" in your desktop! ***
